# Video Editing Studio Frontend

This is the frontend React application for the Video Editing Studio.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js (v14+) installed
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Development Mode

To run the frontend in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start in development mode and open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
The page will reload if you make edits.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
